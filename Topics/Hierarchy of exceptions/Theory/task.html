In such a paradigm, all exceptions are considered objects of special classes organized into a class hierarchy.

<h5 id="checked-and-unchecked-exceptions">Checked and unchecked exceptions</h5>
<p>All exceptions can be divided into two groups:<strong> </strong>checked and unchecked. They are functionally equivalent but there is a difference from the compiler's point of view.</p>
<p><strong>1. Checked exceptions</strong> are represented by the <code class="language-java">Exception</code> class, excluding the <code class="language-java">RuntimeException</code> subclass. The compiler checks whether the programmer expects the occurrence of such exceptions in a program or not.</p>
<p>If a method <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3553" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The 'throw' keyword in Java is used to throw an exception manually at any point during the execution of a program. | It is used in conjunction with an object of a class that extends the Throwable class, which is the superclass of all exception classes in Java. The throw statement consists of the keyword 'throw' followed by the object to be thrown. It is typically used when a method's preconditions are broken and it cannot be performed under the current conditions.">throws</a> a checked exception, this must be marked in the declaration using the special <code class="language-java">throws</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a keyword is a reserved word that has a special meaning in the programming language. | These words cannot be used as variable names in your own program. Keywords are part of the syntax, a set of rules that define how a program needs to be written in order to be valid. For instance, the keyword 'final' is used to declare a constant variable, indicating that its value cannot be changed after being initialized. However, the use of keywords can sometimes make code less readable due to boilerplate code, hence their usage should be standardized in a project.">keyword</a>. Otherwise, the program will not compile.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the example. We use the <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> class, which you are already familiar with, as a means to read from <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9055" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The standard input in Java is a default source of input for a program, which is typically associated with the keyboard. | It is a mechanism provided by the operating system for a program to consume data, and can be redirected from a file or other sources. The standard input is commonly used in programming problems to read data, process it, and output the result to the standard output. It can be accessed in Java using the standard class, which allows a program to read values of various types from the standard input.">standard input</a>, to read from a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3635" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a file is a representation of a file or directory in a file system, managed by the File class in the java.io package. | It can be used to perform various operations like reading, writing, and manipulating files and directories. The File class treats a directory as a file, and provides methods to check if a file exists, to create a new file or directory, to delete a file or directory, and to rename a file or directory. It also provides methods to get information about a file, such as its name, path, and last modified time.">file</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static String readLineFromFile() throws FileNotFoundException {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("file.txt")); // throws java.io.FileNotFoundException
    return scanner.nextLine();
}</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-java">FileNotFoundException</code> is a standard checked exception. This constructor of <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> declares that it may throw the <code class="language-java">FileNotFoundException</code> exception if the specified file does not exist. To ensure that this method can be compiled successfully, we must include the <code class="language-java">throws</code> keyword in the method declaration to indicate that the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A method in Java is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. | It is a fundamental unit of functionality in Java, similar to a function in other programming languages. Methods are used to encapsulate code, making it reusable and modular. They can take inputs in the form of parameters, and return outputs. Methods can also be overloaded, allowing for multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. They are a crucial part of object-oriented programming, as they represent the behavior of objects and classes.">method</a> may throw the <code class="language-java">FileNotFoundException</code> exception. As a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9955" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the term result typically refers to the output or value produced by a method or function after it has completed its execution. | This result can be of any data type, including primitive types like int, float, or boolean, or reference types like arrays or objects. The result is usually returned to the caller of the method or function using the return statement. It's important to note that not all methods or functions in Java have a result, as some are designed to perform a specific action or modify an object's state without producing a value.">result</a>, the caller of this method will need to decide whether to either handle the exception internally or throw it further to its caller method.</p>
<p><strong>2. <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3552" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An unchecked exception in Java refers to exceptions that are not checked at compile-time. | They are also known as runtime exceptions. These exceptions are not explicitly declared in a method's throws clause. Examples of unchecked exceptions include NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Unchecked exceptions are typically caused by programming errors, and they do not need to be handled or declared in the method signature.">Unchecked exceptions</a></strong> are represented by the <code class="language-java">RuntimeException</code> class and all its subclasses. The compiler does not check whether the programmer expects the occurrence of such exceptions in a program.</p>
<p>Here is a method that throws a <code class="language-java">NumberFormatException</code> when the input string has an invalid format (e.g., <code class="language-java">"abc"</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static Long convertStringToLong(String str) {
    return Long.parseLong(str); // It may throw a NumberFormatException

<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">
<p>Runtime exceptions may occur anywhere in a program. The compiler doesn't require that you specify runtime exceptions in declarations. Adding them to each method's declaration would reduce the clarity of a program.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The <code class="language-java">Error</code> class and its subclasses are also considered as unchecked exceptions. However, they form a separate class.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>All exceptions are represented by the <code class="language-java">Throwable</code> class, which has two subclasses: <code class="language-java">Exception</code> and <code class="language-java">Error</code>. There are also two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked.</p>
<p>Unchecked exceptions are not validated by the compiler, so you don't have to handle them. They are represented by the <code class="language-java">RuntimeException</code> subclass of the <code class="language-java">Exception</code> class. Errors from the <code class="language-java">Error</code> class are also considered unchecked.</p>
<p>Checked exceptions have to be handled and indicated explicitly. They are located in all the other subclasses of <code class="language-java">Exception</code>.</p>
