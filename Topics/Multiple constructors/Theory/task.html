<h2>Multiple constructors</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Sometimes we need to initialize all fields of an object when creating it, but there are cases in which it might be appropriate to initialize only one or several <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11523" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A field in Java is a variable that is declared within a class, and it is used to store data. | It can have any type, including primitive types (such as int, float, boolean, etc.) and class types (even the same class). A class can have multiple fields, and they are used to store the current state or data of the instance of the class. Fields can be accessed and modified through methods, and they are a crucial part of object-oriented programming in Java.">fields</a>. Fortunately, for this purpose, a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/19918" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A class in Java is a fundamental concept that serves as a blueprint for creating objects. | It defines the properties and behaviors of an object through the use of fields and methods. Fields describe the object's characteristics, while methods describe what the object can do. Classes can be divided into two categories: instance and static. Instance classes are defined using the class keyword, followed by the class name, and can have any name that does not start with a digit.">class</a> can have several constructors that assign values to the fields in different ways.
