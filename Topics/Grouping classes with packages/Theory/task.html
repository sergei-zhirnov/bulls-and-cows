<h2>Grouping classes with packages</h2>

<p>Large Java projects have a lot of classes and it's difficult to manage them if they are stored in the same directory. <strong>Packages</strong> provide a mechanism for <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10512" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, grouping refers to the mechanism of organizing classes together in the same module or package. | This aids in managing large Java projects with numerous classes by making it easier to locate specific classes, avoiding conflicting class names, and controlling access to class and member with access modifiers.
