However, the use of keywords can sometimes make code less readable due to boilerplate code, hence their usage should be standardized in a project.">keyword</a> can be used in several cases:</p><ul><li><p>to access instance <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11523" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A field in Java is a variable that is declared within a class, and it is used to store data. | It can have any type, including primitive types (such as int, float, boolean, etc.) and class types (even the same class).
