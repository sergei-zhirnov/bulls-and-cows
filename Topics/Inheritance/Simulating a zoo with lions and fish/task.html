<h2>Simulating a zoo with lions and fish</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<div class="alert alert-warning">Hey there! This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</div>You are given a task to simulate a Zoo. Your job is to create an abstract class Animal that has name and age as properties. The Animal class should include a toString() method that returns a string in the format of 'name: {name}, age: {age}'. Then, create a Lion class that extends Animal and includes a roar() method returning 'roar!'. You also need to create a Fish class that extends Animal and includes a swim() method returning 'swim!'. For simulation, you will receive a string either 'Lion' or 'Fish' and you need to create an instance of the corresponding class, set its name to 'Simba' if 'Lion' and 'Nemo' if 'Fish', and its age to the integer value provided. Return the respective Animal's toString followed by respective method output. For example, if you received 'Lion' and the age 3, you should return 'name: Simba, age: 3, roar!'. Simulate the zoo using the provided animal type and age.<br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Lion<br>3</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">name: Simba, age: 3, roar!</code></pre><br><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Fish<br>5</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">name: Nemo, age: 5, swim!</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
