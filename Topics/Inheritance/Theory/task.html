<p>When it comes to inheritance, there are several terms.

A derived class is related to its superclass through a parent-child relationship, where the derived class is the child and the superclass is the parent.

<p>a superclass can have more than one subclass.</p>

</ul>
<p>A subclass inherits all <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3589" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, 'public' is an access modifier, which is a special keyword that specifies who is allowed to use your code or a part of it. | It can be placed in front of any field, method, or class.

The keyword 'public' means that the method is available to everyone, making it accessible from any other class in the application.">public</a> and <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3589" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, protected is an access modifier that allows a class member to be accessed from classes in the same package and all subclasses of this class. | It is less restricting than package-private, but more restricting than public.

<p>Let's consider a more graphic example. A telecommunication company serves <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/14268" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a client refers to an entity that uses or consumes the services provided by another entity, typically a server. | It can be a program, a system, or even a user that interacts with the server to access the resources or functionalities it offers.

It has a small staff consisting only of managers and programmers. Let's consider a class hierarchy for people associated with the company's activities (including clients).</p>
<p>At first, we present the hierarchy as a figure. An arrow indicates that one class extends another one.</p>

<p>the base class <code class="language-java">Person</code> has fields for storing common <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9723" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, data is separated into two main categories: primitive types and reference types. | Primitive types are built-in data types provided by the language, such as int for integers, and they are represented as lowercase keywords. Reference types, on the other hand, represent objects and are typically created using the new keyword, which allocates memory for the object and initializes the variable. String is a commonly used reference type, and it can be instantiated using either a constructor or a literal, like Hello, World! .">data</a>: name, year of birth, and address;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the class <code class="language-java">Client</code> has additional fields to store the contract number and status (gold or not);</p>

<li>
<p>the class <code class="language-java">Employee</code> stores the start date of work for the company and the salary;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>the class <code class="language-java">Manager</code> may have a dazzling smile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see the code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Person {
    protected String name;
    protected int yearOfBirth;
    protected String address;

    // public getters and setters for all fields here
}

class Client extends Person {

    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This hierarchy has two levels and five classes overall. All fields are <code class="language-java">protected</code> , which means they are visible to subclasses. Each class also has public <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3599" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, getters and setters are methods used to access and modify the private fields of a class, while adhering to the principles of data encapsulation. | They are identified by their naming convention, with getters starting with 'get' followed by the variable name, and setters starting with 'set' followed by the variable name. Getters for boolean fields start with 'is'.

<p>Let's create an object of the <code class="language-java">Programmer</code> class and fill the inherited fields using the inherited setters. To read the values of the fields, we can use inherited getters.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Programmer p = new Programmer();

p.setName("John Elephant");
p.setYearOfBirth(1985);
p.setAddress("Some street, 15");
p.setStartDate(new Date());

p.setProgrammingLanguages(new String[] { "Java", "Scala", "Kotlin" });

System.out.println(p.getSalary()); // 500000
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(p.getProgrammingLanguages())); // [Java, Scala, Kotlin]</code></pre>
<p>We also can create an instance of any class included in the considered hierarchy.</p>
<p>So,<strong> inheritance</strong> provides a powerful mechanism for code reuse and writing convenient hierarchies. Many things in the real world can be simulated, like hierarchies from a more general to a more particular concept.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> allows you to build class hierarchies where subclasses (children) take some fields and methods of the superclass (parent). Such a hierarchy can have multiple levels, but every class can inherit only from a single superclass. A good class hierarchy helps to avoid code duplication and makes your program more modular. If a class should not have subclasses, it should be marked as <code class="language-java">final</code>.</p>
